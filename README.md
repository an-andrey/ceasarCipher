# Caesar Cipher Demo

I have created this website in order to demonstrate the [Caesar Cipher](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/caesar-cipher#:~:text=The%20Caesar%20cipher%20is%20a,another%20in%20a%20consistent%20fashion.) while presenting my research project in Number Theory and Cryptography under the supervision of Professor Takei at John Abbott College.

## Usage

1. In the text box, enter your secret message.
2. By clicking the _Shift +_ and _Shift -_ buttons you can adjust by how many letters your secret message get's shifted by. The letters in the inner wheel get mapped to the ones of the outer wheel.
   > **Note**: Special symbols and the capitalization of letters are preserved as-is.
3. Press reset in order to set the shift back to 0

I am no longer supporting the url of the website, but you can clone this repo and run the file locally.

### Enjoy!
